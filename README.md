## Quantifying and evaluating enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in RiboErase and poly(A) RNA-seq data

Enhancers function as distal DNA regions which enhance the transcription of target genes, usually through interaction with the gene promoter site. In 2010, Kim et al. reported that active enhancers are also transcribed into non-coding RNAs referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).  eRNAs are reported to be tissue and cell lineage-specific making them excellent markers for enhancer activation. Numerous studies have also reported eRNAs to play a critical role in regulating gene transcription, however, the exact mechanism of eRNA function is still unknown. 
According to the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM) Project, almost 10% of total eRNAs are polyadenylated. These polyadenylated (polyA) eRNAs are frequently longer (almost 4 kb) and unidirectionally transcribed, whereas non-polyadenylated eRNAs are shorted (346 bases), unspliced, and bidirectionally transcribed. Many eRNAs are also associated with long non-coding RNAs and are reported to have clinical implications as potential target therapy in diseases such as cancer. Taken together, due to high heterogeneity in literature amongst the structural and functional role of eRNAs they remain a rich topic for exploration and future analysis.
